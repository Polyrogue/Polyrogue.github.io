# About Me

My name is Taha Nasir, and I am a second year Computer Science Student at Goldsmiths. A passionate programmer, I spend most of my spare time working on personal projects in multiple languages, usually developing games. Of course this is all when I'm not playing games myself. An avid PC Gamer, my computer is my near and dear to my heart, and nearly everything I do revolves around it.

Not everything, though. When I'm not sat in front of a screen, I might be with my Taekwondo club. I've competed in sparring, earned a medal, and even volunteered as a corner judge at the Student Nationals in March 2017 and 2018.

I'm always available to contact, and am greatly interested in finding a game development position upon my graduation in Summer 2019.
