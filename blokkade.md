**Developed in: Unity (C#)**

**Date: July 2017**

Blokkade is a 3D Arcade game I developed for Android devices in July 2017. It was developed over the course of about a month as my first professional project in Unity, programmed in C#. It was a great learning experience, and I am extremely proud of the finished game - its minamlist aesthetic is professional and polished.

I also learned a great deal about 3D space and 3D manipulation.

Some revenue is being earned from it, but I spent many hours ensuring the best way to make the monetisation as unintrusive as physically possible - the main goal was just to make the game fun. In the end, the game has received numerous positive reviews, and has been cited as "fun" and "addictive".

The game is available for free on the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.polyrogue.blokkade&hl=en).
