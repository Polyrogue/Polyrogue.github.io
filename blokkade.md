**Developed in: Unity (C#)**

**Date: July 2017**

Blokkade is a 3D Arcade game I developed for Android devices in July 2017. It was developed over the course of about a month as my first professional project in Unity, programmed in C#. It was a great learning experience, and I am extremely proud of the finished game - its minamlist aesthetic is professional and polished.

I also learned a great deal about 3D space and 3D manipulation.

Some revenue is being earned from it, but I spent many hours ensuring the best way to make the monetisation as unintrusive as physically possible - the main goal was just to make the game fun. In the end, the game has received numerous positive reviews, and has been cited as "fun" and "addictive".
