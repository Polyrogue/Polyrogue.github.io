*“Ludum Dare”, the Accelerated Game Development Event of the same name (also called a “Game Jam”). During a Ludum Dare, developers from around the world spend a weekend creating games based on a theme suggested by the community.*

I have been participating in the Ludum Dare every year since 2013, when I was fifteen years old. With only 72 hours to make the game, I've become adept at starting and finishing projects in a small timeframe.

At first I used GML, but in the last year or so I have switched to Unity and C#. Some of my entries have done very well. My very first entry, out of two thousand entries, earned 282nd "overall" and 40th for "most fun".
A more recent entry earned 24th "most fun". 

The games are all rated and reviewed by other developers, and several have made livestreams or videos playing and praising my entries.

The games are still avaliable to be played on the old Ludum Dare webite and the new one.
