**Developed in: Unity**

**Date: July 2018 - August 2018**

Spearhead was a game I made inspired by one of my Ludum Dare entries called Igknight. I wanted to make a game on mobile about throwing spears, and I knew I wanted it to be of a synth-pop aesthetic. My knowledge with Unity since making Blokkade had vastly improved, and the game is far more complex, efficient and smooth.

As is often the case, the main functionality had been completed within three weeks. However, the graphics, sound and music needed doing, and I wanted it to look better than I could draw. I could not have completed this project without the offered help of my university friends. Credited below, I then began to work closely with [Aileen Tan]() as she drew the art for the game, and Phoebe Izzard Davies for the audio. The music came toward the end, exactly how I envisioned it, made by Aileen's sister, [Quincy Tan](). Working and leading a team of that size, even for simple assets, was a brilliant experience, and I am very grateful for their help.

The game itself is a fast-paced synth-pop style arcade game, requiring you to draw and loose electric spears, featuring a vocoder, daft-punk style narrator (voiced by me, that was a lot of fun).

Spearhead is available for free on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.polyrogue.spearhead).
